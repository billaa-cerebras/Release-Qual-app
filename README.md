# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Environment Variables

To use the Confluence import feature, you'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Atlassian credentials:

```bash
ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN=your-atlassian-api-token
```

The `.env.local` file is ignored by Git, so your credentials will remain secure.
